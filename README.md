This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.3.

## Run locally

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Todo
- [ ] Remove bootstrap component library
- [ ] Create global changeable settings (interval, p1 meter IP, How long to keep graph (15m),...)
- [ ] Format hours, minutes, seconds with leading zero's in tooltip of graph
- [ ] Improve reuse between both power-injection components
- [ ] Improve reuse between cards (all components use & style them separately now)
